## Module that allows cached comutations upon a Matrix
## Out of scope: Checks for changed data

## Creates a data structure, that holds the data, the cache and getters/setters for the values

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## solves the computation possibly using a cached value

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
